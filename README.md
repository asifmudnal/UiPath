# UiPath
This process aims at sorting of Resumes which the HR receives during the time of Companies Recruitement and it is hectic job for HR to open every mail download it and then screen each and every resumes and Sort them . this process is time consuming and very difficult so with the help of UiPath it has been automated where

* The Robot checks the HR email on regular Interval and if there are any Resumes from the candidate then Downloads it and  save it in a folder
* ThE robot will separates the Resumes based on format like PDf or Docx file and move them to respected folder.
* Next the Robot will screen each folder like first pdf folder and then Docx folder 
* It starts screening each adn every resumes in it search for the particualr keyword like Technology or Experience or Location based on our condition or Input we provide to be searched .
* if the Respected keyword is found and if that Resume belongs  to that category then it craetes the respected folder and move that particular resume to that folder 
same goes for all the Resumes and in both folders 
 
with the help of this process it is very easy for the HR to search for the particular resumes without filtering all the resumes and wasting time.
